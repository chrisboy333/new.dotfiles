# Skype does this lovely thing where it calls out to firefox (not
# gnome-www-browser; not x-www-browser) and tries to open the link in
# an existing instance of firefox with the -remote argument, and if
# firefox returns with a non-zero exit code (because there is no
# instance running), then it tries to just start a new instance of
# firefox with that URL.
#
# Well, when firefox is called with -app for conkeror, it does not
# return non-zero with -remote (even though it fails), so Skype
# assumes that the link was opened successfully (even though it
# wasn't).  Here we just short circuit that so that we can get
# straight to the opening of the link.
